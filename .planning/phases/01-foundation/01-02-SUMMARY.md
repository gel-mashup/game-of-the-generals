# Phase 01 Plan 02: Game Board UI Summary

**One-liner:** Complete 9×8 CSS Grid board, piece rendering with rank icons, piece palette (21 pieces), deployment zone visualization, and lobby leave functionality.

## What Was Built

Implemented the complete Phase 1 game UI building on the foundation from Plan 01-01.

**Components:**

### Board Component
- 9-column × 8-row CSS Grid (`grid-cols-9 grid-rows-8`)
- Alternating square colors: `#4a7c4a` (light) and `#3a6a3a` (dark)
- 9:8 aspect ratio maintained with `aspect-[9/8]`
- Max width `max-w-3xl` for responsive layout
- 4px border in `#2d4a2d` (secondary green)
- Renders `Piece` components for non-null board cells

### Piece Component
- Circular container (`rounded-full`) with owner color background
- Red pieces: `bg-red-600` → Blue pieces: `bg-blue-600`
- Rank symbols: 5★, 4★, 3★, 2★, 1★, Col, LtC, Maj, Cpt, 1Lt, 2Lt, Sgt, Pvt, Spy, ⚑
- Opacity-60 when not revealed
- Click handler for piece selection

### PiecePalette Component
- Horizontal scrollable row (`overflow-x-auto`) with custom scrollbar
- Shows all 21 piece types from PIECE_CONFIG
- Count badges (gray rounded pills) showing remaining pieces
- Selected state: `ring-2 ring-[#d4a847]` (gold border)
- Mini piece preview with owner color
- Short labels: "5★ Gen", "Colonel", "Pvt", "Flag", etc.
- Disabled state for fully deployed piece types

### DeploymentZone Component
- Red zone: `rgba(192, 57, 43, 0.15)` overlay on rows 0-2 (top 3 rows)
- Blue zone: `rgba(41, 128, 185, 0.15)` overlay on rows 5-7 (bottom 3 rows)
- Dashed border indicators at zone boundaries
- Only visible during `deploying` gameStatus
- Absolute positioning for overlay on board

### Game Page
- Full integration: Board + DeploymentZone + PiecePalette
- Game header: room code (gold monospace), player badges (red/blue), status, leave button
- Cell click handler for piece deployment
- Deployment validation: only valid zones, no overlaps
- Leave confirmation dialog with "Leave Room" / "Cancel" options

### Lobby Page (Enhanced)
- `player:left` socket event updates UI in real-time
- Leave confirmation dialog with destructive styling
- Confirmation text: "Leave Room: You'll need the room code to rejoin. Are you sure?"
